          <h3>Bulk File Renamer</h3>
          <p>
            This bulk file renamer was made for my CS 1030 class, since I'm a
            self taught programmer for around 8 years I pushed myself to create
            a UI to show the program off instead of just creating a simple text
            based program. This program does what is says, it renames up to
            thousands of files with a custom prefix that you can change.

          <h3>Tell Me A Joke</h3>
          <p>
            One afternoon I was set out to practice programming. I didn't really
            know what to do (being creative can be tough...). I ended up
            settling on a joke teller, it first takes an excel file full of
            jokes and then uses a robot to listen for your intrest and tell you
            the joke along with the punchline.

          <h3>Amazon Reveiw Scraper</h3>
          <p>
            I recently started trying to complete proposals from people on
            Upwork as practice and to learn lots that I haven't played around
            with. This is the result of one of the jobs to scrape Amazon reviews
            and the color of the product that these reveiwers had purchased.

          Hi, my name is William! Most people call me Kyle and I am a computer
          programmer. Over the years I have found a fond love for creating
          things that I can think of. I've been passionate about programming
          from a young age, and that passion has only grown stronger over the
          years. As a child, I was captivated by the world of computers and the
          endless possibilities they offered. My journey in programming has been
          marked by a deep curiosity and an insatiable desire to learn. Whether
          it's creating software applications, websites, or solving complex
          problems through coding. I hope you can enjoy the projects that I have
          so far and can join me for my future projects!
