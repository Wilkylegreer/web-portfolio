<h3>Tell Me A Joke</h3>
        <p>
          One afternoon I was set out to practice programming. I didn't really
          know what to do (being creative can be tough...). I ended up settling
          on a joke teller, it first takes an excel file full of jokes and then
          uses a robot to listen for your intrest and tell you the joke along
          with the punchline.

<h3>Amazon Reveiw Scraper</h3>
        <p>
          I recently started trying to complete proposals from people on Upwork
          as practice and to learn lots that I haven't played around with. This
          is the result of one of the jobs to scrape Amazon reviews and the
          color of the product that these reveiwers had purchased.

<h3>Bulk File Renamer</h3>
        <p>
          This bulk file renamer was made for my CS 1030 class, since I'm a self
          taught programmer for around 8 years I pushed myself to create a UI to
          show the program off instead of just creating a simple text based
          program. This program does what is says, it renames up to thousands of
          files with a custom prefix that you can change.
